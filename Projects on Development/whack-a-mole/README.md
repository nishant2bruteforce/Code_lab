# Whack-a-Mole

Simple Whack-a-Mole game built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Beginner-friendly project to learn DOM manipulation, event handling, timers, and simple animations.

- Responsive and accessible (keyboard support for mole elements).

How to run
1. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or use Live Server).
2. Pick a duration, then click Start.

Files
- `index.html` â€” game UI and controls.

I cannot assign GitHub issues or add labels from this local edit. To assign this issue and add labels from GitHub's web UI:
1. Open the issue on GitHub.
2. On the right sidebar choose 'Assignees' and pick the contributor.
3. Under 'Labels' add `hacktoberfest` and `hacktoberfest-accepted` (or ask a repository maintainer to add them).
